    <p>
        This ham tastes very much like the famous honey baked ham, but <em>costs much less</em>.
        You can even buy ham presliced to make it easier and more like the original - it is very good.
        I do this while preparing the rest of the meal in the kitchen so that I don't forget to baste!

        Ingredients
        <ul>
            <li>1 (5 pound) ready-to-eat ham</li>
            <li>1/4 cup whole cloves</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dark corn syrup</li>
            <li>2 cups honey</li>
            <li>2/3 cup butter</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Directions
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Score ham, and stud with the whole cloves. Place ham in foil lined pan.</li>
            <li>In the top half of a double boiler, heat the corn syrup, honey, and butter. Keep glaze warm while baking ham.</li>
            <li>Brush glaze over ham, and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Baste ham every 10 to 15 minutes with the honey glaze. During the last 4 to 5 minutes of baking, turn on broiler to caramelize the glaze. Remove from oven, and let it sit a few minutes before serving.</li>
